## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on
  - Research in cybersecurity

- 🌱 I’m currently learning
  - STIX and working with the ATT&CK framework

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
  - Cybersecurity modelling, in general

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with
  - Accommodating good research questions into well-sound scientific papers. 

- 💬 Ask me about
  - Markov Chains
  - Dependability plus cyber-security
  - Stochastic modelling & simulation

- 📫 How to reach me:
  - rczekster at gmail

- ⚡ Fun fact:
  - I support Internacional, the best football team in the world.

### Projects you should take a look
- Look at my Markov Chains book: [github/czekster/markov](https://github.com/czekster/markov)
- I recently (Nov/25) (self-)published a book on Threat Modelling CAVs: [https://github.com/czekster/tm-cavs](https://github.com/czekster/tm-cavs)
 
### Research prospects
- Dependability modelling
- Cybersecurity and Attack Modelling Techniques (AMT)
- Threat Modelling
- Cyber Threat Intelligence using STIX(tm) modelling and the ATT&CK framework

### Domains
- Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet-of-Things (IoT)
- Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV)
